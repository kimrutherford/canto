#      In Annotation Extension:
#      Please enter annotation extensions that help to specify the nature of the interaction (in any order), each separated by a comma, using the following relationships:
#
#      For Pathogen Strain used in the experiment, use pathogen_strain(NCBItaxon:<taxonID>), where the taxonID is the identifier for the NCBI taxon of the experimental pathogen strain
#
#      For Host Organism use experimental_host(NCBItaxon:<taxonID>), where <taxonID> is the NCBI taxon identifier for the host organism
#
#      For Host Tissue use occurs_in(BTO:<tissueID>), where <tissueID> is the BRENDA tissue identifier for the host tissue
#
#      For Disease use causes_disease(DO:<diseaseID>) or causes_disease(PDO:<diseaseID>), where <diseaseID> is the identifier for either the animal disease (from the Disease Ontology) or the plant disease (from the Plant Disease Ontology)
#
#      For the response from the experimental host use response(HRO:<hostResponseID>), where <hostResponseID> is the identifier for the relevant term in the Host Response Ontology. 
#
#      For an interaction that has been induced by the addition of a chemical agent, use induced_by_chemical(ChEBI:<ChEBIID>), where <ChEBIID> is the ChEBI identifier for the inducer chemical 
#
#      For an interaction that has been induced by the addition of a gene or gene product, use induced_by_gene(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene product
#
#      For an interaction that has had an anti-infective chemical added, use anti_infective(ChEBI:<ChEBIID>), where <ChEBIID> is the ChEBI identifier for the anti-infective chemical 
#
#      For a protein in the host known to interact with the pathogen gene or gene product, use host_interacting_protein(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene in the host
#
#      For a protein in the pathogen known to interact with the pathogen gene or gene product, use pathogen_interacting_protein(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene in the pathogen

#      In Optional Comments:
#      Please provide any additional details you have, such as:
#      i) Genes or proteins used in the assay (especially for phenotypes that affect protein or RNA level, or protein localization)
#      ii) Penetrance or severity of the phenotype
#      The curators will record this additional information in PHI-base.
#
#      In Annotation Extension:
#      Please enter annotation extensions that help to specify the nature of the interaction (in any order), each separated by a comma, using the following relationships:
#
#      For Pathogen Strain used in the experiment, use pathogen_strain(NCBItaxon:<taxonID>), where the taxonID is the identifier for the NCBI taxon of the experimental pathogen strain
#
#      For Host Organism use experimental_host(NCBItaxon:<taxonID>), where <taxonID> is the NCBI taxon identifier for the host organism
#
#      For Host Tissue use occurs_in(BTO:<tissueID>), where <tissueID> is the BRENDA tissue identifier for the host tissue
#
#      For Disease use causes_disease(DO:<diseaseID>) or causes_disease(PDO:<diseaseID>), where <diseaseID> is the identifier for either the animal disease (from the Disease Ontology) or the plant disease (from the Plant Disease Ontology)
#
#      For the response from the experimental host use response(HRO:<hostResponseID>), where <hostResponseID> is the identifier for the relevant term in the Host Response Ontology. 
#
#      For an interaction that has been induced by the addition of a chemical agent, use induced_by_chemical(ChEBI:<ChEBIID>), where <ChEBIID> is the ChEBI identifier for the inducer chemical 
#
#      For an interaction that has been induced by the addition of a gene or gene product, use induced_by_gene(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene product
#
#      For an interaction that has had an anti-infective chemical added, use anti_infective(ChEBI:<ChEBIID>), where <ChEBIID> is the ChEBI identifier for the anti-infective chemical 
#
#      For a protein in the host known to interact with the pathogen gene or gene product, use host_interacting_protein(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene in the host
#
#      For a protein in the pathogen known to interact with the pathogen gene or gene product, use pathogen_interacting_protein(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene in the pathogen
