Contractile ring localization is the part of cytokinesis in which contractile ring is assembled and/or maintained in a specific location." [GO:1902405, PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that the location of the contractile ring is determined by the location of the cell division site, so an abnormality in cell division site determination can be inferred from this phenotype. Consider also annotating to 'abnormal septum site selection' (FYPO:0002154) because if the contractile ring forms in an abnormal location, the septum will also do so. The positions of both the contractile ring and the septum are determined by the processes that select the site of cell division.

comment: In a cut phenotype, the septum may partition the two nuclei into the two daughter cells, partition both nuclei into one daughter cell, or physically divide one nucleus, depending on septum placement. Note that if you have done an experiment that assays the viability of a population of cells, such as looking at colony growth or growth in liquid culture, you should also annotate to 'inviable cell population' (FYPO:0002059) or one of its descendants.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. There may be enough evidence to support annotation to a more specific term such as 'abnormal transcriptional response to pheromone' (FYPO:0000984); if not, it is safer to annotate to 'increased transcription during vegetative growth' (FYPO:0000780) or 'decreased transcription during vegetative growth' (FYPO:0000781) rather than explicitly claiming that an effect on regulation was observed.

def: "A vegetative cell population growth phenotype in which cell growth is decreased relative to normal in a medium containing glycerol as the carbon source." [PomBase:al, PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that trace amounts of another carbon source are usually required for S. pombe growth on glycerol; yeast extract-based rich medium supplies the trace substance, but minimal medium must be supplemented. It is therefore important to annotate the growth medium as an experimental condition when using this term. Note that cell growth terms refer to growth under aerobic conditions unless stated otherwise.

comment: Note that mating efficiency is often measured by counting zygotes plus asci, sometimes also including spores, so a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see FYPO:0000031 and its descendants), a change in sporulation (see FYPO:0000121 and its descendants), or both.

In some dumbbell-shaped cells, the diameter at the ends is much greater than in wild-type cells." [PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that dumbbell-shaped cells are usually also elongated. The distinction between this phenotype and swollen elongated cells (FYPO:0001429) is that dumbbell-shaped cells have a constriction along the long axis, whereas swollen elongated cells do not. Note that if you have done an experiment that assays the viability of a population of cells, such as looking at colony growth or growth in liquid culture, you should also annotate to 'inviable cell population' (FYPO:0002059) or one of its descendants.

comment: The difference between this term and 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) is that 'mislocalized protein' describes a protein that is observed in a place where it is not normally found, whereas 'abnormal protein localization' additionally encompasses the absence of protein from a place where it is normally found. FYPO:0000782 can therefore be used in any case where a protein is in a different location in a mutant compared to wild type, whereas additional information is usually required to support annotation to FYPO:0000443 or its descendants. We recommend noting which protein(s) were used in the assay when annotating to this term.

comment: Note that wild-type cells become shorter under nitrogen starvation conditions than under nitrogen-replete conditions, and that mutant cells subjected to nitrogen starvation may have lengths similar to wild type cells under non-starved conditions. Also note that this term is classified as a type of abnormal cell shape, because under a given set of conditions wild-type cells are never seen with the proportions (length:width ratio) observed in elongated cells. Small cells, in contrast, have the same proportions as a subset of wild-type cells, and simply do not grow to the full length seen in wild type. This term can be used for any circumstances in which cells are starved for nitrogen. Note that cells may enter G0 (quiescence) when subjected to prolonged nitrogen starvation; this term is not restricted to G0.

Note that if you have done an experiment that assays the viability of a population of cells, such as looking at colony growth or growth in liquid culture, you should also annotate to 'inviable cell population' (FYPO:0002059) or one of its descendants.

comment: Note that the location of the contractile ring is determined by the location of the cell division site, so an abnormality in cell division site determination can be inferred from this phenotype. Consider also annotating to 'mislocalized septum' (FYPO:0000339) because if the contractile ring forms in an abnormal location, the septum will also do so.

def: "A cellular process phenotype in which vegetative cell population growth does not occur, although cells remain viable." [PomBase:mah]
comment: This term's primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we recommend that it not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using one of the more specific terms, which mention carbon or nitrogen sources, to annotate each phenotype, as cells that do not grow on any media would be considered inviable.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. Note that in budding yeast, increased plasmid loss is often called a minichromosome maintenance defect, because "minichromosome" is roughly synonymous with an autonomously replicated and segregated plasmid in that organism. In fission yeast, a minichromosome is a large portion of a chromosome, usually about half of chromosome 3, that replicates and segregates autonomously. For smaller autonomously replicating and segregating constructs, consider 'increased plasmid loss' (FYPO:0000786).

comment: Note that this term can be used to annotate any case where a protein is found in the nucleus in a mutant, but not in wild type. In some cases, there may be enough additional information to annotate to 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) or one of its descendants. We recommend noting which protein(s) were used in the assay when annotating to this term.

def: "A cellular process phenotype observed in the vegetative growth phase of the life cycle in which the occurrence of cellular pigment accumulation is increased during a cellular response to caffeine." [PomBase:mah]
comment: Note that normal cells do not accumulate detectable levels of any pigment; for this reason, FYPO does not include separate terms for 'increased' and 'abnormal' pigment accumulation. Also note that pigment accumulates in the vacuole. This term refers to GO:0033059 'cellular pigmentation', rather than GO:0043482 'cellular pigment accumulation', because GO:0043482 has paths to 'response to stimulus' in GO.

comment: Note that this term can be used to annotate any case where a protein is found in actin cortical patches in a mutant, but not in wild type. In some cases, there may be enough additional information to annotate to 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) or one of its descendants. We recommend noting which protein(s) were used in the assay when annotating to this term.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype. Use a descendant of this term if you have assayed growth of cells exposed to a stress in culture. If you have assayed the response to the stress at the subcellular or molecular level, consider annotating to a descendant of 'abnormal cellular response to stress' (FYPO:0000162).

comment: Note that normal cells do not accumulate detectable levels of any pigment; for this reason, FYPO does not include separate terms for 'increased' and 'abnormal' pigment accumulation. Also note that pigment accumulates in the vacuole. This term refers to GO:0033059 'cellular pigmentation', rather than GO:0043482 'cellular pigment accumulation', because GO:0043482 has paths to 'response to stimulus' in GO.

name: mislocalized protein
def: "A cell phenotype in which a protein is observed in a particular location where it is not normally found." [PomBase:mah]
comment: The difference between this term and 'abnormal protein localization' (FYPO:0000443) is that 'mislocalized protein' describes a protein that is observed in a place where it is not normally found, whereas 'abnormal protein localization' additionally encompasses the absence of protein from a place where it is normally found. FYPO:0000782 can therefore be used in any case where a protein is in a different location in a mutant compared to wild type, whereas additional information is usually required to support annotation to FYPO:0000443 or its descendants. We recommend noting which protein(s) were used in the assay when annotating to this term.

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.
