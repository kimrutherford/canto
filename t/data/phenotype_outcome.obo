[Term]
id: POO:0000005
name: effector (plant avirulence determinant)
def: "Some effector genes are required to cause disease on susceptible hosts but most are not. A plant pathogen-specific term which was previously referred to as a corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene. An effector gene is formally identified because its presence leads to the direct or indirect recognition of a pathogen in resistant host genotypes which possess the corresponding disease resistance (R) gene. Positive recognition leads to activation of plant defense and the pathogen either fails to cause disease or causes less disease. In the absence of the pathogen, effector delivery into a healthy plant possessing the corresponding R gene activates plant defense responses." []

id: POO:0000008
name: resistant to chemical
def: "The transgenic strain grows and/or develops normally when exposed to chemistry concentrations that are detrimental to the wild-type strain." []
comment: Molecular studies on natural field isolate population are also considered, once the natural target site has been identified.

[Term]
id: POO:0000009
name: sensitive to chemical
def: "The transgenic strain which expresses either no or reduced levels of a specific gene product(s) or possesses a specific gene mutation(s), has the same ability as the wild-type strain to grow and develop when exposed to detrimental chemistry concentrations." []
comment: On rare occasions increased sensitivity to chemistry has been observed.
