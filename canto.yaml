      In Annotation Extension:
      Please enter annotation extensions that help to specify the nature of the interaction (in any order), each separated by a comma, using the following relationships:

      For Pathogen Strain used in the experiment, use pathogen_strain(NCBItaxon:<taxonID>), where the taxonID is the identifier for the NCBI taxon of the experimental pathogen strain

      For Host Organism use experimental_host(NCBItaxon:<taxonID>), where <taxonID> is the NCBI taxon identifier for the host organism

      For Host Tissue use occurs_in(BTO:<tissueID>), where <tissueID> is the BRENDA tissue identifier for the host tissue

      For Disease use causes_disease(DO:<diseaseID>) or causes_disease(PDO:<diseaseID>), where <diseaseID> is the identifier for either the animal disease (from the Disease Ontology) or the plant disease (from the Plant Disease Ontology)

      For the response from the experimental host use response(HRO:<hostResponseID>), where <hostResponseID> is the identifier for the relevant term in the Host Response Ontology. 

      For an interaction that has been induced by the addition of a chemical agent, use induced_by_chemical(ChEBI:<ChEBIID>), where <ChEBIID> is the ChEBI identifier for the inducer chemical 

      For an interaction that has been induced by the addition of a gene or gene product, use induced_by_gene(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene product

      For an interaction that has had an anti-infective chemical added, use anti_infective(ChEBI:<ChEBIID>), where <ChEBIID> is the ChEBI identifier for the anti-infective chemical 

      For a protein in the host known to interact with the pathogen gene or gene product, use host_interacting_protein(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene in the host

      For a protein in the pathogen known to interact with the pathogen gene or gene product, use pathogen_interacting_protein(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of the gene in the pathogen

      Where multiple gene interactions occur, use interaction_partner(UniProt:<UniProtAcc>), where <UniProtAcc> is the UniProt accession of another pathogen gene involved in the interaction

      For Example:
      
      To curate a phenotye caused by the KJ201 strain of the Magnaporthe oryzae pathogen, which causes rice blast disease in the seedling of host Oryza sativa (Rice), resulting in increased necrosis, when the current pathogen gene is part of a multiple gene interaction together with gene TGL3-2, then the following notation would be used in the annotation extension:

      A biological process is series of events accomplished by one or more

    more_help_text: >
      It can be difficult to distinguish between a biological process

      have more than one distinct steps (eg. cell cycle, transport, signal
      transduction).

      A new term should be differentiated from the parent as a "sub term"  by
      the mechanism of action, or the genes which are required to perform the
      action. It should not be differentiated only by its target gene
      products. For example, histone H2A-S121 phosphorylation
      is a valid term request because it is performed by a set of genes
      specific for this process, translation of histone H2a is not a valid
      term request because there is no translation machinery specifically for
      histone H2a.

      Start typing a description of a condition. If one of the autocomplete
      options matches, click it to add it to the box. If none match, you can type
      out a new description and it will be saved.
      If you tested a set of conditions all at once (e.g. grew cells at high
      temperature and in minimal medium), put the condition descriptions together
      in a single box. For conditions tested one at a time (e.g. separate
      experiments at high and low temperature, or separate cultures with high and
      low glucose levels), list each condition separately.

        If there is any information in your paper which you could not capture in
        the curation tool, please describe the data briefly, as the
        curators may be able to include it in the database.

      <p>
        Examples include:
        <ul>
        <li> multi-gene phenotypes
        <li> substrates of gene products (e.g. protein substrates of kinases or protein transporters)
        <li> "targets" of localization dependencies (e.g. gene A localizes gene B) 
        <li> cell cycle phases when a process occurs (during)
        <li> specific residues modified in annotated protein modifications (e.g. phosphorylated on residue S45)
        <li> protein domain data or other protein sequence features
        <li> missing gene names (synonyms)
        <li> transcriptional regulation (of the WT allele - transcriptional changes due to mutations can be captured in the tool)
        <li> complementation data (whether the pombe gene complements a homologue in a different organism or vice versa; complementation may be full, partial or absent)
        <li> gene product name updates
        <li> human or budding yeast orthologs
        </ul>
        Most of these annotation-types will be handled in future releases of the
        curation tool.
