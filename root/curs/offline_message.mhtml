Canto is offline

    <p>
Canto, PomBase's literature curation tool, will be unavailable for
approximately 3 weeks starting on 2015-05-28 while we deploy an upgraded
version.
    </p>
    <p>
The upgraded Canto will feature an entirely new interface for annotating
multi-allele phenotypes and the corresponding genotypes, as well as improved
workflows for single-allele phenotypes, GO, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
All of your existing annotations will be retained, and you can resume curation
using the new and improved features in any unfinished sessions when Canto is
back online.
    </p>
    <p>
Watch for the next announcement here, when the new version of Canto is
released to the public.
