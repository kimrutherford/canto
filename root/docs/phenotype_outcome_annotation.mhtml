<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
A phenotype is any observable characteristic
or trait of an organism resulting from the interactions between its genotype with
the environment. PomBase aims to get full coverage of phenotypes
described in the literature - therefore we strongly encourage community
curators to request new terms if an appropriate term to describe a phenotype does
not yet exist.
</p>
<p>Please note that <i>annotations should always be made to the term
definition</i>, not the term name.</p>

<h2>Types of phenotypes</h2>
<p>
Phenotypes may be observed on a population level (for instance
"flocculating cells"), a cellular level (for instance "abnormal morphology"),
or a sub-cellular level (for instance the abnormal localization of a protein
in a cell deleted for a different gene). Additionally, annotations may also be
made where an enzyme activity is lost in a mutant (for instance through
mutations in an active site or deletion of an activator).
</p>

<h2>Normal phenotypes</h2>
<p>
Often, a mutant will be assayed for a phenotype but the mutation has had no
observable effect compared to wild-type cells. These mutants may be annotated
to the sub-set of "normal" phenotypes (where normal is defined as no
observable difference to wild-type cells). For instance, a mutant may be
annotated to normal cell growth on amphotericin B or normal cell morphology. A
mutant may be "normal" in one respect, but abnormal in another (for instance,
cells may grow at a normal rate, but have an abnormal morphology).
</p>

<h2>Targets of mutated genes</h2>
<p>
Where appropriate, a comment should always be included to specify which gene
products (proteins or RNA) were quantified in an experiment. This is because
the product quantified may not be originate from the gene that was mutated in
the first place. Sometimes, a mutation in gene A will lead to a change in the
behavior of protein B. For instance, deletion of gene A may cause normally
nuclear protein B to localize to the cytoplasm, or perhaps the amount of RNA
from gene B is increased. In these cases the annotation should be made to gene
A, and a comment should be included that it is gene B that is
affected. Sometimes it may be necessary to specify two targets. For instance,
if a mutation in gene A cause "decreased binding" between protein B and
protein C.
</p>

<h2>Phenotypes of wild-type cells</h2>
<p>
Please note that only <b>mutant</b> phenotypes are curated using the tool
- i.e. changes observed in cells compared to wild-type cells when the
DNA sequence of a gene is altered, or when its expression level is changed (or
both). Any changes occurring in wild-type cells in response to a stimulus (for
instance a phenotype resulting from the inhibition of a wild-type gene when it
binds a substance) can therefore not be captured in the phenotype section of
the tool.  In this particular case, we can attach an "annotation extension" to
a gene stating that the substance inhibits its gene product. Please include
information of this sort in a coment.
</p>

<h2>Making annotations - Locating a term</h2>

<p>Phenotype terms can be located by typing
relevant keywords into the search-box. For instance, if cells grow slowly on galactose
typing "slow growth" will retrieve a number of terms (se image below, left
panel). Mousing over a term name will show its definition and any relevant
comments. If you cannot immediately see an appropriate term in the box, click
on a more general term, e.g. "slow cell growth", and a list of more specific
terms will be displayed underneath. You may from here select a more specific
term (for instance "slow cell growth on galactose carbon source" - see
the right panel below) or keep the more general term. If you think a more
specific child term is appropriate but it does not yet exist you may click the &nbsp;"suggest
a new child term" link found below the list of child terms. </p>

<h2>Making annotations - adding alleles</h2>

<p>Once a term has been selected the option of
adding an allele and evidence becomes available. Several alleles can be added
to the same phenotype term (for instance, different point mutations in a gene
may result in the same phenotype). The allele box contain several fields:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Allele name</b>: this field is optional.
    Fill this in if the allele is named, for instance cdc25-22.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Allele type</b>: choose an allele type in the dropdown menu. Different
    options are available. For some choices, e.g. partial deletions or
    mutations, further specifications are needed and a grey-font help-text
    will be displayed in the box (note that mutations in promoter regions can
    also be specified by prefixing the numbers with a minus "-" sign). If the
    specific mutations are not known choose "unknown". If the alterations are
    complex (for instance a mixture of insertions and mutations etc) choose
    "other" and free-text the information.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Expression level</b>: You will be prompted
    to define the expression level relative to wild-type (deletion mutants are
    automatically set to null). The default for all other mutants is "not specified"
    but may be changed to endogenous, overexpression or knockdown. If a wild-type
    allele was investigated then an altered expression level must be set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Evidence</b>: Select the evidence code that best describes the assay
    employed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Conditions</b>: You may add a set of
    experimental conditions that were employed during the assay and may have had an
    impact on the cells. Several conditions can be added for one experiment. If you
    have performed the same experiment under several different conditions and
    observed the same phenotype you can tick the box "Re-use
    allele name and description with a different set of conditions".
    </p>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Glucose minimal medium vs. glucose rich medium (synonyms for some
        standard media are available, for instance EMM or YES and carbon
        sources other than glucose can be specified)
      </li>
      <li>
        Agar plates vs. liquid medium
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition of certain chemicals, for instance in a salt stress
        experiment it may be of interest to note what salts were added.
      </li>
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>
        Exclusion of some chemicals that one might normally expect to be
        present.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h2>Notes on some common phenotypes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Cell growth vs. cell population growth</h3>
    <p>
    Most experiments that measure "growth" observe a population of
    cells, such as a culture in liquid medium or a colony on a
    plate. For these experimens, use one or more of the "cell
    population growth" terms. In contrast, terms such as "normal cell
    growth" refer specifically to growth in the sense of an increase
    in cell size. Also see "Slow growth, decreased cell density and
    decreased growth" below.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Slow growth, decreased cell density and decreased growth</h3>
    <p>
    "Slow cell population growth" refers specifically to when the rate
    of growth (slope) of a cell population is decreased. "Decreased
    cell density in stationary phase" refers to when a population
    reaches stationary phase at, and maintains, a lower cell density
    than wild type (the rate of growth may still be the same as
    wild-type). An allele may be annotated to both terms. If you do
    not know which of these is decreased (typically if cells are grown
    on agar plates for a number of days and then observed) use
    "decreased cell population growth".
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Translation vs. protein level</h3>
    <p>
      Typically, assays such as western
      blots will not distinguish between increased translation or decreased
      degradation. If these cannot be distinguished between then the correct terms to
      use are increased, decreased, or normal protein level. If the assay is
      sensitive enough to distinguish between these, then the translation or
      degradation terms may be used (for instance decreased translation or increased
      protein degradation).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h3>Transcription vs. RNA level</h3>
    <p>
      Typically, assays such as northern blots will not distinguish between
      increased transcription or decreased degradation.  If these cannot be
      distinguished between then the correct terms to use are increased,
      decreased, or normal RNA level. If the assay is sensitive enough to
      distinguish between these, then the transcription or degradation terms
      may be used (for instance decreased transcription).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Phenotype vs. GO annotations</h2>
<p>
  GO annotations should always reflect a
  gene"s direct involvement in, or regulatory role of, processes or functions. In
  contrast, phenotype annotations may reflect downstream or indirect effects.
</p>
<p>
  For instance, cells mutated for a gene involved in cell wall biosynthesis
  may display defects in cytokinesis. This gene should not be annotated to the
  GO process term "cytokinesis" but may be annotated to the FYPO term
  "cytokinesis defects" because its effect on cytokinesis is an indirect
  effect of improper cell wall biosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
  Most commonly, more phenotypes than GO
  terms can be extracted from a paper. Sometimes, several phenotype annotations
  but no GO annotations can be made, because the experiments do not definitely
  home in on the exact process that the gene is involved in.
